# SQL-and-Power-BI
For this Project, I am an analyst working at a health research company in Haiti.  The government has asked my company to analyze data related to covid-19.  To that end, they have provided me with access to health data.
My goal as a Data Manager is to provide
*  Relational Database to manage all the data collection
* Use SQL Language to answers some query provided from the Board
* Build a dashboard with Power BI to illustrate all the activites of covid
